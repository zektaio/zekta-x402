# Zekta Zero-Knowledge Action - Design Guidelines

## Design Concept: "The Invisible Engine"

The website embodies encrypted systems - everything glows softly, moves intelligently, and projects advanced technology that's invisible yet verifiable. Think: StarkWare √ó Solana √ó Apple's design discipline.

## Color Palette

**Base:**
- Deep matte black background: `#0B0D10`
- Neon cyan to electric violet gradient: `#00FFF0 ‚Üí #7C4DFF`
- Thin white typography with translucent panels
- Glow style: subtle encrypted plasma (not club-neon)

**Mood:** Futuristic, Encrypted, Velocity, Light through darkness, Precision minimalism

## Landing Page Structure (Scroll-Based)

### 1. Hero Section - "The Proof of Action"
- Animated 3D node orbit or particle flow collapsing into ZEKTA "Z" logo
- Headline: **"ZEKTA: Zero-Knowledge Action"** with subheadline **"Transactions and proofs without disclosure."**
- Tagline: **"Prove. Execute. Stay unseen. Privacy and performance, finally united."**
- Dual CTAs: "Explore Protocol" (scroll anchor) + "View Demo" (MVP link)

### 2. Overview - "What is Zero-Knowledge Action?"
- Split layout: Left text paragraph, Right animated diagram
- Diagram shows: User ‚Üí Proof ‚Üí Verifier ‚Üí Chain
- Floating text layers fade in: "identity hidden", "proof verified", "action confirmed"

### 3. Features Grid - "Privacy, Proven."
- Four dark cards with glowing borders
- Subtle hover animations
- Icons with titles and descriptions:
  - üîí **Proof-Based Authentication** - Validate without revealing
  - ‚ö° **On-Chain Speed** - Verified off-chain, executed instantly
  - üß© **Composable** - Plug into any DEX, wallet, or DAO
  - üåê **Public Proof Receipts** - Transparent verification, invisible identity

### 4. Workflow Section - "How ZEKTA Works"
- Vertical timeline with 5 steps that light up on scroll
- Micro-animations (encrypted strings flying through network lines):
  1. Identity generated locally
  2. Proof constructed
  3. Proof verified
  4. Action executed
  5. Result confirmed

### 5. Use Cases - "Built for Privacy at Scale"
- Horizontal scroll gallery with flip cards
- Use cases: Private Payments üí∏, Stealth Swaps üí±, ZK-Login üîê, Anonymous DAO Voting üó≥Ô∏è, Proof-Based Access üî≠
- Hover reveals description + "Build this with Zekta SDK"

### 6. Architecture Diagram - "Proof-to-Action Pipeline"
- Neon flowlines on dark background
- Flow: User ‚Üí ZK Proof Engine ‚Üí Verification Layer ‚Üí Blockchain Action
- Each node glows with descriptors: "Unlinkable", "Verifiable", "Transparent"

### 7. Developer Section - "Build with Zekta"
- Code sample with syntax highlighting:
```
const proof = await zekta.prove(identity, action);
await zekta.execute(proof);
```
- Subtext: **"Simple API. Advanced privacy."**
- CTAs: "Docs", "GitHub", "Join Developer Group"

### 8. Closing Banner - "Proof of Trust."
- Centered text: **"ZEKTA - The invisible layer of blockchain action. Zero-Knowledge. Full Velocity."**
- Final CTA: "Start Building"

## Micro-Interactions & Visual Effects

- **Custom cursor:** Glowing ring that appears to scan the page
- **Text animations:** Fade-in effects resembling decrypting messages
- **Menu transitions:** Smooth fades, not slides
- **Scroll triggers:** "Proof verified ‚úÖ" micro-animation after workflow section
- **Hover states:** Cards with subtle glow intensification

## Visual Signature Elements

- **Logo "Z":** Diagonal gap line symbolizing action verified, identity split
- **Optional tagline under logo:** "Zero-Knowledge Action Layer"
- **Footer:** Floating holographic "hash stream" with random proof IDs

## Typography & Copy Tone

**Style:** Concise. Technical. Confident. Single-line definitive phrases.

**Examples:**
- "No signatures. Only proofs."
- "Identity hidden, action verified."
- "Zekta is not private by choice; it's private by design."

## MVP Application (zk.zekta.io)

Separate subdomain with same dark theme but functional UI:
- ZK Identity generation interface
- Group root management dashboard
- Proof execution panel with Solana devnet integration
- Real-time transaction status with Explorer links
- Clean, technical UI matching main site's encrypted aesthetic

## Images

**Hero Section:** Animated 3D particle/node system (not static image) - programmatic animation creating the ZEKTA "Z" logo from flowing particles

**Architecture Diagram:** Custom SVG/Canvas visualization with glowing neon lines connecting nodes in the proof-to-action pipeline

**No large static hero images** - the design relies on animated elements, gradients, and glow effects to create visual impact
